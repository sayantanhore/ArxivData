# This file contains the checklist of things to be done on latex abstracts

1. Check whether the document is in English.
2. Remove markups and put them in an XML file.
3. Remove all mathematical blocks - $ $, $$ $$, \begin{equation} \end{equation}, \begin{equation*} \end{equation*} etc.
4. Remove citations.
5. Remove enumerations.
6. After a clear text is retrieved, pass the text through 'python enchant' to check for spelling mistakes, if any, check if two words are joined with a space missing in between them. Do not count keywords or special words formed with uppercase initial or a hyphen in between.
