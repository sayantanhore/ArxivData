# This file contains the checklist of things to be done on latex abstracts

1. Check whether the document is in English.
2. Remove markups and put them in an XML file.
3. Remove all mathematical blocks - $ $, $$ $$, \begin{equation} \end{equation}, \begin{equation*} \end{equation*} etc.
4. Remove citations.
5. Remove enumerations.
6. After a clear text is retrieved, pass the text through 'python enchant' to check for spelling mistakes, if any, check if two words are joined with a space missing in between them. Do not count keywords or special words formed with uppercase initial or a hyphen in between.

# Markups to remove
# -----------------

Search for patterns like '\begin{<command>}[<options>]<whatever>\end{<command>}'. The <command> shoud match bothways marking the closing of a tag opened before. Remove anything before <whatever> and after it that matches the given patterns. Now check the text <whatever> for other latex constructs like '\item' etc. and remove them. Once pure text remains, run it through the spellchecker.

There are commands for which the '\end{<command>}' does not exist. Have a list prepared for them and match the <command> part with it. If so then do not look for the '\end{<command>}' part, just remove the '\begin{<command>}[<options>]'section.
